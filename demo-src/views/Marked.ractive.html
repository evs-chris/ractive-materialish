    This macro and/or decorator combo takes the markdown embedded within it and renders it into the DOM. If the markdown is just a string, the macro will pre-render it into a triple. If the markdown is a template, it will render it inline, hide the host elemnent, and duplicate it into an additional sibling element using the decorator.

    It is important to tell Ractive to preserve whitespace within any `marked` elemnts using `{ preserveWhitespace: { marked: true } }`. If your markdown happens to have any elements or mustaches in it, you'll also want to add in `interpolate: { markdown: false }`.

    ### Plugin Options

    All options are optional.

    * `name: string = 'marked'` - the name to use when registering the plugin as a macro and decorator
    * `marked: marked = marked` - the `marked` singleton to use to render markdown. If falsey, the global `marked` object will be used. If no `marked` is found, an error will be thrown.

      ### Template:
      ```handlebars
      ## This is a heading
      Paragraphs work too. So do code blocks. In fact, all of the docs here are rendered in `<markdown>` tags.

      > Here's a quote.

      ```
      ### Result:
